"Transformation constantly has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the everyday interpretation or to its complacency and its tranquilized obviousness." Martin Heidegger

Leadership shows up for us as individuals mostly as "observers giving an account," distinct from being present transparent.  

We are s culture that listens for handy information, tips and prescriptions. 
We think that something is useless if we can't use it.
We like to "know about" vs "be present as." 

Notice what you are thinking now; "Of course it is useless if it can't be used. That is stupid"
Maybe what empowers people can't be used by them? Maybe we need a listening that is present for what is powerful and not useful. 

Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry that transforms. The search for answers, formulas, perscriptions etc is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invented rationality.
In other words we think that we were born in such a way that anything that is valid we are going to understand. Therefore anything you don't understand must be invalid. 

"The will to know does not will to abide before what is worthy of thought." Martin Heidegger 

Wanting to fix "what is," is distinct from being with what wants to happen. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7d6e6793-e687-4f7e-9ebe-8a72dc05533b.jpg)
