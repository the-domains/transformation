"Transformation constantly has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the everyday interpretation or to its complacency and its tranquilized obviousness." Martin Heidegger

Leadership shows up for us as individuals mostly as "observers giving an account," distinct from being present transparent.  

We are s culture that listens for handy information, tips and prescriptions. 
We think that something is useless if we can't use it.
We like to "know about" vs "be present as." 

Notice what you are thinking now; "Of course it is useless if it can't be used. That is stupid"
Maybe what empowers people can't be used by them? Maybe we need a listening that is present for what is powerful and not useful. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bbe2105f-d77e-4b51-a5bf-530c2c197a95.jpg)

"The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any iea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of a doubt, what is laid before him."   Leo Tolstoy

Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry that transforms. The search for answers, formulas, perscriptions etc is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invented rationality.

"The will to know does not will to abide before what is worthy of thought." Martin Heidegger 

Wanting to fix "what is," is distinct from being with what wants to happen.
